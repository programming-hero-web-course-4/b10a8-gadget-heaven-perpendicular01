## React Fundamentals Used  
This project demonstrates the following core React concepts:  

- **Functional Components**: Components are created for reusable UI elements, such as product cards, categories, and the navigation bar.
- **Context API**: Shared states for cart, wishlist, and product data are managed using React Context API for a clean structure. 
- **Props and State Management**: Props are utilized for dynamic data rendering, while `useState` efficiently handles local component states.  
- **React Router**: Implements smooth navigation with nested routes and active route indication using `react-router-dom`.  
- **Lifecycle Management**: `useEffect` is applied for side effects like fetching data and updating the UI dynamically.  
  

## Data Handling and Management  
- **Context API**: Shared states for the cart, wishlist, and other data are managed centrally to ensure consistent updates across the application.
